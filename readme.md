# Decision Trees - comparing learning rates of different algorithms

> Paul Leitner, April 2020

I will implement an OO Decision Tree learning classifier with 2 different learning algorithms here; 
[_ID3_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) and [_C4.5_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4.5_algorithm)

The only packages I will rely on here are base python packages such as _math_ as well as _numpy_, 
in order to take advantage of vectorization

Finally, I will include a jupyter notebook with a brief visual comparison of the learning rates and some explanation.

Further notes to be added here.
